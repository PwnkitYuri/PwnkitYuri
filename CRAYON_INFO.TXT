ABOUT: CRYN_475022_COL ("CRAYON BOX COLLECTIVE")

The beasts call themselves many names. Capo/Cappy, Carnation/Carnivea, Anne, Hecate, and Spekta are the ones we hear the most.
But they all also respond to the names Yuri, or Wan/Wander.
-They all respond to any pronouns.

WARNING: they do not like to be touched by people any of them are unfamiliar with, however they are all relatively calm about it
-If approached by someone unknown, they will merely walk away, and request to not be touched
-If the stranger proceeds to touch them, they will be ignored. They all know what reaction you want, they will not give it to you.

The beasts have expressed an odd interest in certain medias, said medias include (but are not limited to)
-A story game called "Great god grove"
-A 'minecraft' series called "Lifesteal"
 -The sandbox game "Minecraft" itself
-The characters from a game called "PHIGHTING!"
 -However the beasts have also stated that they do not play the game nor do they want to associate with the 'fandom'
 -They also enjoy many other things having to do with 'Roblox'
  -Such as two games called "Regretevator", and "Blocktales"
  -They also find myths very interesting
-An anime, manga, and game series that is collectively referred to as "Madoka magica"

However they also have shown interest in things that arent any form of media
-Design theory
-Baking
-And singing

The beasts have also made it clear that they have a certain criteria for those who speak to them
-Of course, they dont want to associate with any homophobes, transphobes, racists, proshippers, endo "systems", ect ect
-They also heavilly dislike overused jokes about any "popular for being problematic" person 
 -Unless any controversy being joked about was far in the past, they dont really care then
